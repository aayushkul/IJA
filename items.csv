Obstetric anaesthesia practice: Dashboard as a dynamic audit tool,"Sunil T Pandya,Kausalya Chakravarthy,Aparna Vemareddy",REVIEW ARTICLE,"            		Rapid advances and improved networking abilities have led to the widespread adoption of technology in healthcare, especially focused on diagnostics, documentation and evaluation, or mining of data to improve outcomes. Current technology allows for rapid and accurate decision-making in clinical care decisions for individual patients, collation and analysis at different levels for administrative and financial purposes, and the ability to visualise, analyse, and share data in real time for departmental needs. The adoption of technology may help to improve efficiency and efficacy of healthcare services. Obstetric anaesthesia is a specialised area that has to address the well-being of the pregnant woman and the unborn baby simultaneously. A shift toward caesarean sections as the major mode of childbirth has led to an increased involvement of anaesthesiologists with childbirth. Decisions are often made in high pressure, time intense situations to protect maternal and foetal health. Furthermore, labour analgesia using various neuraxial and non-neuraxial techniques is being demanded by parturients frequently, and for the materno-foetal safety, risk management is the core issue. Hence, it is essential that obstetric anaesthesia teams regularly audit their outcomes to improve services and to identify potential trouble spots earlier. It may be helpful to have audit parameters displayed as visual data, rather than complex tabular and numerical data, for ease of sharing, analysis, and redressal of problem areas. We describe the design and use of an obstetric anaesthesia dashboard that we have used in our department for the past 5 years.",http://www.ijaweb.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5049;year=2018;volume=62;issue=11;spage=838;epage=843;aulast=Pandya

Anesthetic challenges in a child with Lowe's and Fanconi syndrome,"Shital Digambar Chaudhari,Manpreet Kaur",CASE REPORT,"
      
      
		
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is a rare X-linked metabolic disorder complicated by Fanconi's syndrome. Anaesthetic management of Lowe syndrome with Fanconi's syndrome is challenging to the anaesthesiologists in view of difficult airway due to microcephaly, metabolic abnormalities, and risk of peri-operative seizures. We report a successful anaesthetic management of a case of 2-year-old child scheduled for evaluation under anaesthesia following bilateral lens aspiration surgery.

Optic nerve sheath diameter-guided extubation plan in obese patients undergoing robotic pelvic surgery in steep Trendelenburg position: A report of three cases,"Nambiath Sujata,Raj Tobin,Punit Mehta,Gautam Girotra",CASE REPORT,"
      
      
		
Robotic pelvic surgery requires steep Trendelenburg positioning with pneumoperitoneum which causes raised thoracic and intracranial pressures. In obese patients, the basal thoracic pressures are high. Increased intrathoracic pressure can decrease the cranial venous flow leading to deficient intracranial absorption of cerebrospinal fluid and a further increase in intracranial pressure. Operating times are also longer due to unfavorable anatomy. Such patients frequently have a delayed awakening from anaesthesia due to a combination of factors such as hypercapnoea, acidosis, and raised intracranial pressures. Normocapnoea can be achieved in a ventilated patient towards the end of surgery. In cases where the anaesthetic agents have been washed out and normocapnoea has been achieved, the intracranial pressure may be an important factor causing delayed emergence. The sonographically measured optic nerve sheath diameter correlates with the intracranial pressure. We report three cases of robot-assisted pelvic surgery in obese patients where we used the optic nerve sheath diameter as a guide for the timing of extubation.

Perioperative monitoring of intracranial pressure using optic nerve sheath diameter in paediatric liver transplantation,"Atish Pal,Purnima Dhar,Neerav Goyal",CASE REPORT,"
      
      
		
An elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to cerebral oedema is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in acute liver failure (ALF). We present a case of ICP monitoring with ocular ultrasonography in a 2-year-old child with ALF for liver transplantation. Since invasive ICP monitoring was risky considering the level of coagulopathy, optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) monitoring was done by ultrasound. A value of 4.5 mm was chosen as the cut-off for an ICP >20 mmHg in this child and was checked at regular intervals during the surgery. Ultrasonographic ONSD assessment can be a useful modality in liver transplant recipients, with severe coagulopathy and high ICP. In our specific patient scenario, ocular ultrasound proved to be a valuable safe and noninvasive monitoring tool in this paediatric patient.
